Depth Enhanced Monocular Odometry (Demo) is a monocular visual odometry method assisted by depth maps, and optionally an IMU. This is the slimmed down version of the program for running on embedded systems. It computes the camera frame to frame motion without using bundle adjustment. The full version is available at

Also, another version of the program that uses a camera and a 3D lidar is available at

How to use:

1) Download the program file to a ROS directory, unpack the file and rename the folder to “demo_rgbd_slimmed” (GitHub may add "-xxx" to the end of the folder name). Use “catkin_make” to build the program, then “roslunch demo_rgbd_slimmed.launch”. The launch file should start the program and rviz.

2) Download datasets from the following website. Make sure the data files are for the RGBD camera (not camera and lidar) version. Play the data files with “rosbag play data_file_name.bag”. Note that if a slow computer is used, users can try to play the data files at a lower speed, e.g. “rosbag play data_file_name.bag -r 0.5” plays the data file at half speed.

Notes: 
  
Camera intrinsic parameters (K matrices for rgb and depth images) are defined in the "src/cameraParameters.h" file. The program does not use "/camera_info" messages in the data files. The current parameters are set at the default values for Xtion sensors.

The current program uses “/camera/rgb/image_rect” and “/camera/depth_registered/image” messages published by the “openni_camera” driver. Users can also remap from other messages such as “/camera/rgb/image” (for rgb images) and “/camera/depth/image” (for depth images). However, if using “/camera/depth/image”, pleases remember to change “kDepth” (K matrix for depth images) in the “cameraParameters.h” file to those in the “/camera/depth/camera_info” messages.
